<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>
  This script automates the process of gathering and analyzing fantasy football data.
  It fetches draft pick data, fantasy points per player, and fantasy points per team,
  then populates a Google Spreadsheet with this information.
  It also performs calculations to assess player value and quartile rankings.
</p>

<h2 id="constants">Constants</h2>
<p>
  The script uses several constants to make it easier to update column numbers and headers.
</p>
<code>
const SHEET = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet().getActiveSheet();
const HEADERS = ["NO.", "PLAYER", "NFL TEAM", "POSITION", "FANTASY TEAM", "FPTS", "Player Value", "Quartile Ranking"];
// Column numbers for each header
const DRAFT_PICK_COL = 1;
const PLAYER_COL = 2;
const NFL_TEAM_COL = 3;
const POSITION_COL = 4;
const FANTASY_TEAM_COL = 5;
const FPTS_COL = 6;
const PLAYER_VALUE_COL = 7;
const QUARTILE_RANKING_COL = 8;
</code>

<h2 id="functions">Functions</h2>

<h3>main()</h3>
<p>
  This is the main function that orchestrates the entire flow of the script.
</p>

<h3>retrieveAllData()</h3>
<p>
  Fetches all data from stored script properties and parses them into JSON format.
</p>

<h3>formatAndPopulateHeaders()</h3>
<p>
  Sets up the Google Spreadsheet, including setting column widths and headers.
</p>

<h3>populateData(draftPickData)</h3>
<p>
  Populates the spreadsheet with draft pick data.
</p>

<h3>populateFPTS(fantasyPointsPerPlayerData)</h3>
<p>
  Populates the "FPTS" column in the spreadsheet based on the player's name.
</p>

<h3>populateTeamFPTS(fantasyPointsPerTeamData)</h3>
<p>
  Similar to populateFPTS but for teams.
</p>

<h3>replaceInvalidWithZero()</h3>
<p>
  Replaces any invalid or empty values in the "FPTS" column with zero.
</p>

<h3>calculatePlayerValue()</h3>
<p>
  This function calculates a 'value score' for each player based on several factors:
  their draft pick position, their fantasy points, and their playing position (e.g., Quarterback, Wide Receiver, etc.).
  The score aims to provide a comprehensive view of the player's value within the fantasy league.
</p>
<p>
  The function first organizes the data into an object where each playing position is a key.
  For each position, an array of draft picks and fantasy points is maintained.
  The mean and standard deviation are then calculated for these arrays.
</p>
<p>
  The 'value score' is computed using a Z-score calculation that takes into account the player's draft pick and fantasy points, normalized by their playing position.
  The Z-score is calculated as follows:
</p>

<p>
  Finally, the function writes these value scores back into the Google Spreadsheet, providing a numerical representation of each player's value based on multiple factors.
</p>

<h3>updateQuartileRankings()</h3>
<p>
  Updates the quartile ranking for each player based on their value score.
</p>

<h3>mean(arr)</h3>
<p>
  Calculates the mean of an array.
</p>

<h3>stdDev(arr, mean)</h3>
<p>
  Calculates the standard deviation of an array.
</p>
