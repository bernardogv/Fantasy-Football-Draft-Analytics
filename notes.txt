Go to the fantasy football page and then go to network,
then go to Fetch/XHR and make sure you already hit the
+300 to see all the players and keep hitting more and more - Also you have to do this separately for the defenses
till you are at the end and then just copy and past the
FantasyStats_read into the files and then run the code
Then paste the results into our google sheet

We have two json clean ups one is just the player name and total fantasy points, the other is all the stats
Right now it just makes js files with all the data in them, we could make it its own folder but thats for another time
We have a json file for the teams defenses, we just comment out the other section we are not using - so if it's for the
players we comment out the team file and vice versa
